# Web Application Firewall (WAF) Implementation

A comprehensive Web Application Firewall solution that protects web applications from common security threats.

## Features

- Rule-based filtering for common web threats (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Real-time traffic monitoring and analysis
- Performance optimized rule engine
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Compliance with OWASP, PCI DSS, and GDPR standards
- Automated rule updates and validation

## Architecture

The WAF implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Core WAF Engine**: Rule processing and request filtering
2. **Rule Management**: Configuration and management of security rules
3. **Monitoring System**: Real-time traffic analysis and logging
4. **Authentication System**: Secure access control and RBAC
5. **Performance Optimizer**: Latency and throughput optimization
6. **Compliance Validator**: Standards compliance checking

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Nginx/OpenResty
- ModSecurity
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Grafana

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

python src/main.py
```

2. Access the dashboard:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
