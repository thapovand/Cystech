# Web Application Firewall (WAF) Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Web Application Firewall (WAF) implementation. The WAF is designed to protect web applications from common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

## Architecture

The WAF implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Core WAF Engine**: Processes and validates incoming requests against security rules
2. **Rule Management**: Manages security rules and their configurations
3. **Monitoring System**: Tracks and analyzes traffic patterns and security events
4. **Authentication System**: Handles user authentication and authorization
5. **Performance Optimizer**: Ensures optimal performance and resource utilization
6. **Compliance Validator**: Checks compliance with security standards

## Components

### 1. Core WAF Engine

The WAF engine is responsible for:
- Request validation and filtering
- Pattern matching against security rules
- Threat detection and blocking
- Request/response modification

Key features:
- Real-time request analysis
- Multiple rule types support
- Custom rule creation
- Anomaly detection

### 2. Rule Management

The rule management system handles:
- Rule creation and modification
- Rule grouping and organization
- Rule import/export
- Rule versioning

Supported rule types:
- SQL Injection
- XSS
- CSRF
- Path Traversal
- Custom rules

### 3. Monitoring System

The monitoring system provides:
- Real-time traffic analysis
- Threat detection and logging
- Performance metrics
- Alerting and notifications

Integration with:
- Elasticsearch for logging
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization

### 4. Authentication System

The authentication system includes:
- User management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT token authentication
- Session management

### 5. Performance Optimizer

Performance optimization features:
- Request caching
- Rate limiting
- Resource optimization
- Latency monitoring

### 6. Compliance Validator

Compliance validation for:
- OWASP standards
- PCI DSS requirements
- GDPR regulations
- Custom compliance rules

## Configuration

### Nginx Configuration

The WAF is integrated with Nginx through ModSecurity. Key configuration files:

1. `config/nginx/default.conf`: Main Nginx configuration
2. `config/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf`: ModSecurity rules

### Security Rules

Security rules are defined in:
- `src/core/waf_engine.py`: Core rule definitions
- `src/core/rule_manager.py`: Rule management
- `config/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf`: ModSecurity rules

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Nginx with ModSecurity
- Elasticsearch
- Redis
- Grafana

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start the services using Docker Compose

### Configuration

1. Update Nginx configuration
2. Configure ModSecurity rules
3. Set up monitoring
4. Configure authentication

## Usage

### API Endpoints

- `/api/rules`: Manage security rules
- `/api/metrics`: View performance metrics
- `/api/compliance`: Check compliance status
- `/health`: Health check endpoint

### Monitoring

Access monitoring dashboards:
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
- Kibana: http://localhost:5601

## Security Considerations

1. **Rule Updates**
   - Regularly update security rules
   - Monitor for new threats
   - Test rule changes in staging

2. **Performance**
   - Monitor system resources
   - Optimize rule processing
   - Implement caching where appropriate

3. **Authentication**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Implement MFA
   - Regular access reviews

4. **Logging**
   - Secure log storage
   - Regular log rotation
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **High Latency**
   - Check rule complexity
   - Review caching configuration
   - Monitor system resources

2. **False Positives**
   - Review rule patterns
   - Adjust rule sensitivity
   - Update rule exceptions

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Check token validity
   - Verify user permissions
   - Review session configuration
